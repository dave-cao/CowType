<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Typing is one of the only games I play nowadays. In my free time (when I'm not coding), I'm on typeracer or MonkeyType typing like a maniac. 

It gives me a sense of satisfication as well as a sliver of productivity. Therefore, I decided to take a crack on making a typing game myself. Introducing: **CowType**. A simple and minimalistic speed type tester with a colour scheme inspired by GruvBox. This lets you type for long periods of time with low strain on the eyes.

### Built With

Python3, Pygame

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

Currently there is no future plans for this project. However, there are some things I thought of
that might be interesting to add:
1. Have the input text overlay the prompt text
2. When a word is typed incorrectly, instead of having everything turn red, make only the word turn red
3. You can't press and hold backspace, you have to press it one at a time
